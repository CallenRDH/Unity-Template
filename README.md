# Unity-Template 3D URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
## Using Ver 2022.3.48f1
### Also anyone can contribute to this, this is just to help newer devs into the motions and give them a little more ground to stand on
most likely i will add more to this template like basic animations and a model aswell but for now its just an empty project
simple Template for people to use on unity that uses URP 
im doing this because its an annoyance to setup new repos so this is just a tool anyone can use
