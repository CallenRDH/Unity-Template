# Unity-Template 3D URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
## Using Ver 2022.3.48f1 
most likely will add more versions later on but this is where we will start
Also, anyone can contribute to this, this is to help newer devs get into the motions and give them a little more ground to stand on
For anyone who needs this, I recommend a code editor Visual Studio Code (VSC) or Visual Studio (VS)
